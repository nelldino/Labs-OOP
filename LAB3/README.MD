# **DIVINE LINEAGE AND SHAPESHIFTING**

Inheritance in OOP allows you to create new classes (subclasses) based on existing classes (superclasses). In Greek mythology, lineage plays a significant role, as gods pass down their traits and powers to their descendants.Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. In Greek mythology, gods and creatures often had the ability to change their forms or appearances.
